# Pose-world

## Motivation: In search of the possibilities of clubs in the remote age

Ever since Covid, it's become difficult to hold events at clubs due to the concern of the virus spreading.
On the other hand, there are no concerns with holding events online. However, online music events to be oneway from artist to the crowd, with the crowd often solely listening and outputting no particular inforamation. This is in contrast to real events where the crowd would dance, enjoy music in their own taste, and interact with each other. With the lack of interaction between the crowds, the online music events tend to lack the fun that clubs had so I wanted to think about some possibile potentials of internet virtual musical events.

## Extracting Dance with Pose estimation

One thing that I would expect in a virtual music events is for the crowd to be able to dance. In other words, the crowd should be able to share their pose information and view each others pose information in real time.
A very simple solution is to live stream the webcam feeds of the crowds. However, this comes with the downside of the webcam feed including unaesthetic elements such as messy room in the background, or poor lighting.
A webcam feed has too much information and similar to how clubs in real life dim the lights, or apply strobe effect to obscurify people for aesthetic purpose there should be some obfusation of the webcam feed.
A solution to this is to use VR but VR devices are not in the hands of many, limiting those who would like to join. Hence a more inclusive solution would be to use pose accuracy, which makes it a viable solution for extracting the pose from a webcam video feed.
